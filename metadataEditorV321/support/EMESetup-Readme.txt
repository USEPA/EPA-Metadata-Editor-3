Installation and Configuration Instructions for the EPA Metadata Editor
**************************************************************************************************************

*****Very Important!!!*******
If you have EME 3.0 or earlier installed on your machine, you must uninstall it BEFORE uninstalling ArcGIS 9.X.
If you uninstall ArcGIS 9.X first, then you will get an error when uninstalling EME (‘Unable to get installer types...’).  This error is generated by reliance upon ESRI assemblies.  If the ESRI components are removed from your machine before the EME (or other custom components) are uninstalled, then the uninstallation will fail. 

A patch has been developed to address this problem.  The patch is named "EME_3.0_Uninstall_Patch.zip" (affectionately called MoTRIn, or Mo Tangestani Registry Intervention, for Mo Tangestani [EPA Region 9] for his patience with this issue prior to the development of the patch).   

To use the patch, 
1. Extract contents of EME_3.0_Uninstall_Patch.zip
2. Go to EME install folder and copy the contents of EME_3.0_Uninstall_Patch.zip to the folder, replacing the ones that were originally installed by EME installer.
3. Uninstall EME from Add/Remove Programs control panel
4. EME should uninstall correctly

Installation Requirements:
The EME may be run as a standalone product or as an ArcGIS Extension. 
In order to install EME and run in either mode, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 must be installed on your machine.
Microsoft's .NET Framework 3.5 is freely available and can be accessed from Microsoft's website.  
As of the release of this version of EME, the website for the distributable package is:
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=21
You can determine if the .NET Framework is on your machine by going to Start->Control Panel->Add or Remove Programs.  
You should see Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 listed.  Multiple versions of Microsoft .Net Framework (e.g., 1,2,3) may exist on your machine simultaneously.

If you plan to use the EME as an ArcGIS Extension, then you must also have the following: 
-ArcGIS 10 or higher must be installed on your machine.  
-The ArcGIS 10.0 (Desktop) FGDC Metadata Style Patch must be installed on your machine. This patch is free and is available at:
http://resources.arcgis.com/content/patches-and-service-packs?fa=viewPatch&PID=160&MetaID=1637

Installing the EPA Metadata Editor
**************************************************************************************************************
1. If you have any version of EME already installed on your machine, you must uninstall it prior to installing the latest version of EME. EME may be uninstalled by going to Control Panel->Add/Remove Programs. 

2. If you have installed a pre-release or beta version of EME v3.2 on your machine (likely limited to small number of EME 3.2 beta testers), it is recommended to remove the EME database in your user directory. The EME database is usually found at: "C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Roaming\Innovate! Inc\EPA Metadata Editor v3.2\metadata.mdb." Simply delete the metadata.mdb in your user directory and it will be replaced with the newest version of the mdb when EME 3.2 loads. Please note that this will remove any customizations you may have applied to the EME databse.  If you want to retain those customizations, you can copy your edits into the new EME 3.2 database. If you have to reinstall the fully functional EME v3.2 at any point in time, you can either choose to delete the EME database from your user directory OR retain the custom version you created in your user directory.   

3. Double click the EME set up file (EME_3.2.msi)

4. Follow set-up instructions
