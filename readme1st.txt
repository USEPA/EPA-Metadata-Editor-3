In order to work with EME source code, your software development environment needs to satisfy several requirements:

- Base requirements for running EME
	- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
	- ArcGIS Desktop 10.x
	- FGDC Metadata Style Patch (for ArcGIS Desktop 10.0 with no Service Pack)
- Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2010
- ArcGIS Desktop SDK for the Microsoft .NET Framework
- Microsoft Access (if database changes are needed)
- Microsoft HTML Help Workshop (if you want to compile your own help file)
 

Please note that before you can compile the code, you will need to generate new COM GUIDs and enter them in VB.NET files as needed. We have removed our GUIDs to avoid conflicts. 

If your version of EME will run on any other computer than the one you are developing on, we would appreciate re-branding it as something other than "EPA Metadata Editor" or EME. Thank you for your understanding!
